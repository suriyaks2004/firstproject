Hunger and malnutrition create a self-sustaining barrier that keeps people stuck in poverty</p></div>
<div class="p2"><p>THERE IS A VIRUS THAT HAS KILLED SO MANY PEOPLE FOR YEARS. THAT VIRUS IS CALLED HUNGER AND ITS VACCINE IS FOOD. HOWEVER, NO ONE TALKS ABOUT IT. BECAUSE THIS VIRUS DOESN'T KILL THE RICH <br> Don't waste food.

<div class="p3"><img src="images/p3.jpeg" height="400" width="500"><p>The smile of a small child with food is a magical moment that encapsulates pure joy and innocence. It is a heartwarming sight that radiates happiness from their sparkling eyes to their rosy cheeks. As they take a bite of their favorite treat or savor a mouthful of a home-cooked meal, their genuine delight is palpable.</p></div>
<div class="p4"><p>Donating even a small amount to help the needy can have a profound impact on the lives of those facing hardship and adversity. It is an act of compassion and solidarity that transcends borders and unites us in our shared humanity. Your generous contribution can provide much-needed resources for those struggling to access basic necessities like food, clean water, shelter, and healthcare. It can empower vulnerable communities, support educational opportunities for underprivileged children, and aid in disaster relief efforts during times of crisis.</p><img src="images/p4.jpg" height="400" width="400"></div>

<h3>SHARING FOOD IS NOT LOSSING THE MONEY<br>
<h5>The most precious thing I have to give is my time. “It is every man's obligation to put back into the world at least the equivalent of what he takes out of it. “No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. “Think of giving not as a duty, but as a privilege.</h5><br>
