		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<p class="p">We are three friends pursuing final year . In our school days we have have done some social activities through "INTRACT CLUB" like collecting money ,food and groceries to the needy people now we are continuing the good activity , we are trying to move to the next level by creating a website "LIVE TO GIVE". We started ZERO HUNGER scheme,
		Zero Hunger is one of the Indian Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is defined as the objective to ensure that everyone has access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and preferences, and that all people have the ability to acquire the food they need, without compromising their economic, social, and environmental well-being.

Although there is more than enough food produced today to feed many people, there are up to 828 million people that remain chronically undernourished. Malnutrition is taking a heavy toll across developing and developed nations. There are more than two billion adults, adolescents, and children who are now obese or overweight. These concerning trends coincide with the diminishing availability of land; increasing soil and biodiversity degradation, and more frequent and severe weather events.  
			Your support helps create a more just and compassionate world for all beings, human and nonhuman alike, by empowering both vegan advocates and nonvegans through training and awareness raising.<br>

We are able to do our unique and innovative work only because of the ongoing support of generous donors like you.<br> <span>Thank you!</span></p>
